# Backlog

One Markdown file per feature or bug: `NNN-short-slug.md` (e.g. `004-market-zone.md`).
Open items live here; `done` and `wontfix` items move to [done/](done/) (same filename) when they close.
IDs are sequential across features and bugs and span both folders: the next id is the highest in either, plus 1. Copy a template from `_templates/`, or ask
Claude to create the item (the `spec` skill).

## Status flow

| Status | Meaning | Who moves it on |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Idea captured; a behavior question is still open | You answer it → `ready` |
| `ready` | Criteria written; can be picked up (you review them at `red-review`) | Claude starts → `in-progress` |
| `in-progress` | Branch exists; work underway | Claude writes failing tests → `red-review` |
| `red-review` | Failing tests written; waiting for your review | You approve → `in-progress` (green phase) |
| `review` | Green, refactored, verified; waiting for your final look (and manual UI check, if any) | You accept → `done` |
| `done` | Merged to `main` | — |

Other statuses: `blocked` (say why in the Log) and `wontfix`.

## See the board

```bash
grep -H '^status:' docs/backlog/[0-9]*.md
```

That lists open items only. Add `docs/backlog/done/[0-9]*.md` to include closed ones.

## Writing good acceptance criteria

Each criterion should become one or more tests. Write it as Given / When / Then with
concrete numbers from the rules:

- Good: *Given 3 food and a Farm (cost 2) in hand, when I play it, then food is 1 and the Farm is on the tableau.*
- Too vague: *Farms should cost food.*

Put anything you can only judge by eye (layout, feel, animation) under **Manual check**.

## Planned order

Build in this order; IDs are creation order, not build order. Each item assumes the ones before it are done.
The order of the 100+ items already closed is in [done/HISTORY.md](done/HISTORY.md).

1. 142 diffusion: earlier-era techs get cheaper (after 140)
2. 143 Iron Age techs in the deck, research pacing (after 139–142)
3. 144 Unrest resource, government unrest limit (from `spike/unrest`)
4. 145 Anarchy at the unrest limit (after 144; once-per-era pacing assumes 143)
5. 146 leaving Anarchy: half-limit government, restore order (after 145)
6. 147 renewal: trash from the discard during Anarchy (after 146)
7. 148 revolution events: choose to revolt (after 147)

Not scheduled: 149 balance pass for the action economy, Insight and Unrest (draft: its scope questions are open).
